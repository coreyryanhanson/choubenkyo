The basic structure of the app is partially inspired by the Android app, [Obenkyo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Obenkyo). This repo here is essentially for the prototype that soley exists to collect observations for the machine learning models. The big changes will occur when this is rewritten in Java and will introduce multiple character sets while leveraging Tensorflow Lite.
